- **Quentin Atkinson** is Associate Professor in Psychology at the University of Auckland and 
  co-director of the [Language, Culture and Cognition Lab](https://www.facebook.com/LCCLab). 
  [His research](www.quentinatkinson.com) uses computational modeling tools to study the 
  evolution of language and culture. He is co-leader of Glottobank.  
- **Wolfgang Barth** works on data discovery and formation. He finds and sorts kinship systems 
  and numeric systems for Parabank.
- **Damián Blasi** is a postdoc at the University of Zürich and an external member of the 
  MPI SHH where he uses large-scale typological databases to make inferences on the 
  relevance of non-linguistic factors on linguistic structures, and provides general 
  statistical assistance for Glottobank.
- [**Remco Bouckaert**](https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~remco/) is a research fellow affiliated 
  with the University of Auckland, and developing new methods to infer deep language 
  relationships using the Glottobank data.
- **Thiago Chacon** is a professor at the University of Brasilia, who works with languages 
  from the Northwest Amazon. He is involved with historical, typological and descriptive 
  linguistic research, as well as interdisciplinary projects aimed at explaining 
  linguistic diversity from a broad historical perspective. Within Glottobank, Thiago is 
  involved in Parabank, Lexibank and Phonobank.
- **Jeremy Collins** is a PhD student at Radboud University, Nijmegen and the Max Planck 
  Institute for Psycholinguistics, researching language structures and what their 
  distributions can show about prehistoric relatedness and contact between languages. He 
  is a Grambank designer and feature patron.
- **Nick Evans** is a typologist and anthropological linguist specialising in Australian and 
  Papuan languages. He is an ARC Laureate Professor at the Australian National University 
  and director of the

  Within Glottobank he is a member of the Parabank Collective and an Associated 
  Collaborator in Grambank. 
- **Robert Forkel** is responsible for strategies and infrastructure for data curation and 
  presentation within the consortium, bringing in the experiences gathered in the 
  [CLLD project](http://clld.org).

  Linguistic and Cultural Evolution at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human 
  History. He is sponsor and co-leader of Glottobank.
- **Harald Hammarström** has a background in linguistics and computer science. He is working 
  in the Grambank project in the design, planning and management as well as website 
  programming and occasional coding.
- **Hannah Haynie** is a postdoctoral associate at Colorado State University, conducting 
  research on the evolution and geography of language and culture. As a historical 
  linguist, she has worked primarily on languages of North America and Australia, and 
  holds a Ph.D. in linguistics from the University of California Berkeley. Hannah is a 
  Grambank designer and feature patron.
- [**Paul Heggarty**](https://shh-mpg.academia.edu/PaulHeggarty) is a senior scientist at 
  MPI-SHH Jena.  Within Glottobank, he contributes 
  linguistic, archaeological and genetic perspectives to Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of 
  Indo-European origins.  He runs the CoBL database project on <u>Co</u>gnacy in <u>B</u>asic <u>L</u>exicon, 
  starting with a database for the Indo-European family, a successor to [IELex](http://ielex.mpi.nl/) by Michael 
  Dunn.  He also runs the [Sound Comparisons](http://www.soundcomparisons.com/) database project for exploring diversity in 
  phonetics across language families from around the world. 
- **Roberto Herrera** is a research assistant working on the Grambank and Parabank projects 
  since June 2015. He is based in Leipzig and works mostly on languages of the so-called 
  Intermediate Area in the Americas. 
- **Jessica Katiuscia Ivani** is a PhD student at the University of Pavia, conducting 
  typological research on the morphosyntax of grammatical features, with a focus on 
  nominal number and gender. Within Glottobank, she is involved in the Parabank project.
- **Kyla Quinn** is a PhD student at the Australian National University in Canberra.  Kyla is 
  a member of the Parabank collective and is researching whether syncretism can be used as 
  a tool for diagnosing phylogeny and contact relationships between languages. 
- **Hedvig Skirgård** is a PhD student in linguistics at ANU and one of the designers and 
  patrons in Grambank. She was previously employed as a coder within the Nijmegen 
  Typological Survey which is the precursor to Grambank

  . Her role in Grambank is to help manage and coordinate coding of 
  languages and the design of the questionnaire. She is the patron for 48 Grambank 
  features, including features concerning negation and tense & aspect. Her PhD project is 
  on factors influencing the diversification of languages, what is it that makes Samoa so 
  different from Vanuatu? 
  [The PhD project](http://chl-old.anu.edu.au/_documents/laureate_project_evans2014.pdf) 
  is a part of the 
  [Wellsprings of Linguistic Diversity](http://www.dynamicsoflanguage.edu.au/the-wellsprings-of-linguistic-diversity/).
